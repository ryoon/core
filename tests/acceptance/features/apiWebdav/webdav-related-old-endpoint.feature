Feature: webdav-related-old-endpoint
	Background:
		Given using API version "1"

	Scenario: Setting custom DAV property using an old endpoint and reading it using a new endpoint
		Given using old DAV path
		And user "user0" has been created
		And user "user0" has uploaded file "data/textfile.txt" to "/testoldnew.txt"
		And user "user0" has set property "{http://whatever.org/ns}very-custom-prop" of file "/testoldnew.txt" to "constant"
		And using new DAV path
		When user "user0" gets a custom property "{http://whatever.org/ns}very-custom-prop" of file "/testoldnew.txt"
		Then the response should contain a custom "{http://whatever.org/ns}very-custom-prop" property with "constant"

	### Scenarios specific to old endpoint

	Scenario: Upload chunked file asc
		Given user "user0" has been created
		When user "user0" uploads the following "3" chunks to "/myChunkedFile.txt" with old chunking and using the API
			| 1 | AAAAA |
			| 2 | BBBBB |
			| 3 | CCCCC |

		And the content of file "/myChunkedFile.txt" for user "user0" should be "AAAAABBBBBCCCCC"

	Scenario: Upload chunked file desc
		Given user "user0" has been created
		When user "user0" uploads the following "3" chunks to "/myChunkedFile.txt" with old chunking and using the API
			| 3 | CCCCC |

		And user "user1" has created a folder "/folderA/ONE"
		And user "user1" has stored id of file "/folderA/ONE"
		And user "user1" has created a folder "/folderA/ONE/TWO"
		When user "user1" moves folder "/folderA/ONE" to "/folderB/ONE" using the API
